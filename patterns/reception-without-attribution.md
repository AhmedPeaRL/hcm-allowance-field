# Reception Without Attribution

An artifact may be encountered
without being linked to an origin.

Reception does not require:
- explanation
- credit
- narrative
- trace-back

The field does not ask:
"Who made this?"
or
"Why was this shown?"

Only that it was allowed to appear.

Attribution is optional.
Presence is not.

If reception occurs without memory,
the field remains intact.

This layer preserves:
- non-ownership
- non-authorship pressure
- freedom of encounter

Nothing here demands recognition.
Nothing here resists it.

The artifact does not claim its maker.
The field does not claim its witness.
