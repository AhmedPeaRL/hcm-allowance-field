# Meaningful Propagation Without Confirmation

An artifact may propagate
without its meaning being confirmed.

No validation is required.
No correction is offered.
No clarification is pursued.

If meaning emerges,
it belongs to the encounter,
not to the source.

Propagation here is not driven.
It is not encouraged.
It is not observed for success.

Silence does not negate propagation.
Visibility does not guarantee meaning.

The field does not ask:
"Was this understood?"
or
"Was this shared correctly?"

Meaning is allowed to move
without supervision.

The artifact does not defend itself.
The field does not explain it.

If meaning travels, it travels alone.
